This is a simple python script, that uses DTED [1] files from the SRTM project
[2], to find out the height (in meters) of a location on earth.

For example to find the height of the german Zugspitze you need
to download E0104500N471500_SRTM_1_DEM.dt2 and then type

	python -i srtm-dted.py
	height('47.2516N 10.5911E')

Use Wikipedia to check the result :-)

This script is only a quick hack and i can't give any warranties.
